# VirtualControlSurfaceLcd

I own a Behringer Midi-Controller BCF2000 that can be setup to emulate a LogicControl (kindof Mackie Control) to control Digital Audio Worktations (DAWs) like Logic Pro or Cubase. The original control surfaces usually have a two row LCD-display that displays textual feedback from the DAW such as the parameter names and values you're currently changing. The BCF2000 has no display, so Behringer offered a PC-Application that emulates the display in a window on your computer screen. Since I use macOS I started writing a Java-Application that does the same. I do not offer prebuild binaries, so if you're interested you'll need to checkout, build an install https://github.com/matatata/curcuma first `mvn clean install` before doing the same with this repository. Then configure the app found in target/virtualcontrolsurfacelcd-x.y.z-SNAPSHOT/ by double clicking the small blue window and put the controller in the middle of the midi-flow between the DAW and the controller. Configure the DAW to send midi-feedback to the virtual MIDI port this app creates. It does work, but it is in alpha status. I use it with macOS-Sierra, Logic-Pro X and the Behringer BCF2000 in LogicControl-Mode. It might work with other devices, OSes and DAWs, but I did never try.
